# Series-2-Aminothiazoles
Screening of the stasis box identified MMV006357 a 2-aminothiazole (1) with useful activity.

This compound is known in the literature and a search of ChEMBL identifies it as [CHEMBL476339](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL476339). It has been screened extensively including:

* GSK Malaria Screening
* Novartis Malaria Screening
* St Jude Leishmania Screening

In the literature it has been described as a potent Kca2.3 channel inhibitor (4 nM) [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2008.08.023). This is a human calcium-activated potassium channel, I don't know if a similar channel exists in Mycetoma?

As with all hits from screening your maxim should be "Trust but Verify", and the first step should be to confirm activity with a fresh sample. If confirmed a couple of approaches are possible.

ChEMBL also contains details of several other chemotypes that are reported to be active at the same molecular target and it might be useful to evaluate them.

These include the cyclic peptide APAMIN [CHEMBL525408](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL525408) (0.064 nM) the interesting cyclic structure [CHEMBL3040285](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL3040285) (31 nM) and the pyrazolo[1,5‚Äê
a]pyrimidine [CHEMBL472452](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL472452) (350 nM). 

If these are active it adds support to this being the possible mode of action.

----------
This structural class is well known in the literature and rather than embark on synthesis it would seem prudent to see if we can access samples prepared for other projects.

A number of analogues were made in an antileishmania project [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2015.08.013) seems to have been a DNDI project can we get samples?

Also actives from antimalarial screen, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.08.048) can we get their samples also?
